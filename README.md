# Recipes

    Mostly came up with these, 1 lunch at a time.
    Each recipe is hand written as individual pdfs. Do with them what you like.                   
    I am a serviceable cook. Nothing less, nothing more. Don't blame me if your house burns down ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

* **[Bacon Burnt Rice Pulao](https://github.com/AnishPimpley/Fat_is_flavor/blob/master/recipe_pdfs/Bacon%20burnt%20rice%20pulao.pdf)**            
The goodness of bacon and the ease of making pulao. Can be made in 1 pot and 20 minutes.

* **[Sausage and Bell pepper Dirty Rice](https://github.com/AnishPimpley/Fat_is_flavor/blob/master/recipe_pdfs/sausage%2C%20onion%20and%20pepper.pdf)**                    
20 minute dish relies on browned hot sausage and sauted onions, garlic and bell peppers to make a for a deep and satisfying rice dish.
